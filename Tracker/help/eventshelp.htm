<body>
    - <b>All of the stuff below is OPTIONAL. You don't need it for the tracking, it's just a service feature.</b><br />
    - Event is e.g. a competition or fly-in.<br />
    - Each event has a list of waypoints, it's the same list as pilots upload to their varios before the comp.<br />
    - Event's waypoints can be used to set up a Today Task for the event.<br />
    - You're supposed to change event's Today Task at every day of the comp.<br />
    - A Pilot Group could have an event assigned, in this case the group's map will display the Today Task for the event.<br />
    - In <b>Single Task Mode</b> there is only one default event, i.e. in this mode you have only one Today Task for all your groups.<br />
    - In <b>Multiple Events Mode</b> you can have many events. E.g. you could use that if you have a joint competition with more than one task running together.<br />
