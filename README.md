Flytrace, online viewer for SPOT trackers
========

Main installation: http://www.flytrace.com/tracker

## Codebase notes:
The project was started back in 2009, so it's predominantly 
based on 2.0 features, especially for async programming which
is pretty much manual. The UI was deliberately made quick & 
dirty, and responsive only in the critical screen - the actual
maps.

Our hosting supports .NET Framework 3.5 only, so 4.x is not 
there yet. Prerequisites for building & running:
- Visual Studio 2013 with Update 4, any edition.
