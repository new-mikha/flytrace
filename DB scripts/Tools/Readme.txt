Use script_db.cmd to generate 03_flytrace_autogenerated.sql file with all the flytrace schema
(02_membership_autogenerated.sql supposed to be the same all the time)

This should be used instead of running scripting from MS SQL Management Studio, to make sure that every time scripting settings are the same (all these "Script Indexes, Script DEfaults" and other settings)

Usage: script_db.cmd server_name db_name output_file_name
Internally it uses SQL PowerShell (thus *.ps1 file), which should be installed with MS SQL Management Studio.
