    <div style="top: 61px; left: 26px; height: 48px; width: 770px;">
        <img alt="" src="images/updateNow.png" runat="server" style="float: left; margin-top: 0px;
            margin-right: 8px" />Click it to manually update the page. Note that there is
        also an automatic update that happens every 30 sec. Pressing this button is 
        faster than
        refreshing the whole page in a browser (e.g. by pressing F5).
    </div>
    <img alt="" src="images/main.png" runat="server" style="position: absolute; top: 128px;
        left: 26px;" />
    <div style="top: 128px; left: 486px; height: 60px; width: 309px;">
        <img alt="" src="images/refreshTime.png" runat="server" style="float: left; margin-top: 2px;
            margin-right: 12px" />Shows when the page was updated. It happens either automatically
        every 30 seconds, or after pressing the &quot;Update Now&quot; link. 
    </div>
    <div style="top: 211px; left: 486px; width: 309px;">
        <img alt="" src="images/marker.png" runat="server" style="float: left; margin-top: 3px;
            margin-right: 8px" />Inside is the first letter of the marker name. Here the
        name is James, so the letter is 'J'. For Anna it would be 'A' and so on. If there
        are James and Jason, there would be two J markers.
        <br />
        <br />
        You could click markers to see their details (coordinates, link to show Full Track
        etc))</div>
    <div style="top: 376px; left: 486px; width: 309px; height: 197px;">
        <img alt="" src="images/markerLabel.png" runat="server" style="float: left; margin-top: 3px;
            margin-right: 8px" />Shows that 5 minutes ago the tracker has sent a signal
        from the point where you see the marker now. It is time when the position was SENT,
        not when it was received. So it means that James has been there 5 minutes ago from
        NOW.<br />
        <br />
        On a real map (this one is just a screenshot) the value would update with a time
        passing, and after a minute it will automatically change to &#39;6 min&#39;.
    </div>
    <div style="top: 393px; left: 25px; width: 432px;">
        <img alt="" src="images/greenLine.png" runat="server" style="float: left; margin-top: 3px;
            margin-right: 8px" />The green line is the latest segment of track: it goes
        from the previous point to the latest position. Note that trackers send coordinates
        every 10 minutes. So this line gives you an instant idea whether tracker moves or
        not.<br />
        <br />
        For example, if this line is 10 kms long then probably the tracker still moves.
        But when it's just 10 meters long (and can be seen only at a highest zoom) it means
        that most likely the tracker has stopped.
